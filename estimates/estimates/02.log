Based on the electrical drawing set provided, I'll create a comprehensive electrical estimate. Let me break this down by major categories:

LIGHTING:
Materials:
- 106 4" Round Downlights @ $85 each = $9,010
- 14 4" Adjustable Downlights @ $95 each = $1,330
- 61 2x2 Troffers @ $120 each = $7,320
- 3 1x4 Troffers @ $110 each = $330
- 13 LED Striplights @ $75 each = $975
- 14 Vanity Lights @ $140 each = $1,960
- 24 Tape Light runs @ $45/ft x avg 20ft = $21,600
- 61 Track Lights @ $95 each = $5,795
- 41 Exterior Surface Pendants @ $175 each = $7,175
- 91 Emergency Battery Units @ $145 each = $13,195
- 36 Exit Signs @ $85 each = $3,060

Lighting Control:
- Network Lighting Control System = $28,000
- Occupancy Sensors and Power Packs = $4,500

POWER DISTRIBUTION:
- Main Distribution Panel = $12,000
- 4 Branch Panels @ $3,500 each = $14,000
- Circuit Breakers and Hardware = $8,500
- SPD Equipment = $4,200

BRANCH CIRCUITRY:
Materials:
- Wire/Cable = $38,000
- Conduit/Raceways = $22,000
- Boxes/Fittings = $9,500
- Devices (Receptacles/Switches) = $12,500

FIRE ALARM SYSTEM:
- Control Panel and Equipment = $18,000
- Devices and Wiring = $22,000

Labor Estimate:
- Electricians: 2,200 hours @ $85/hr = $187,000
- Apprentices: 1,800 hours @ $45/hr = $81,000

Additional Costs:
- Permits and Inspections = $4,500
- Project Management = $25,000
- Testing and Commissioning = $12,000
- As-Built Documentation = $3,500
- Overhead (15%) = $80,115
- Profit (10%) = $61,422

Total Estimate: $720,657

Notes:
1. Includes 10% material contingency
2. Labor includes installation, termination and testing
3. Assumes normal working hours
4. Excludes utility company charges
5. Based on current market prices
6. Includes seismic bracing requirements
7. Includes required testing and certification
