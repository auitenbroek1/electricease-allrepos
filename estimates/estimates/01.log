Based on the electrical drawings provided, I'll create a comprehensive electrical estimate. I'll break this down into major categories:

LIGHTING:
1. Interior Lighting Fixtures:
- 106 4" Round Downlights @ $125 = $13,250
- 14 4" Adjustable Downlights @ $150 = $2,100
- 61 2x2 Troffers @ $200 = $12,200
- 3 1x4 Troffers @ $180 = $540
- 13 LED Striplights @ $120 = $1,560
- Various decorative/specialty fixtures = $15,000
- 91 Emergency Battery Units @ $200 = $18,200
- 36 Exit Signs @ $100 = $3,600

POWER DISTRIBUTION:
1. Panels and Equipment:
- Main Distribution Panel = $12,000
- 3 Branch Panels @ $3,500 = $10,500
- 2 Emergency Inverters @ $5,000 = $10,000
- Surge Protection Devices = $3,000

2. Branch Circuits:
- Approximately 300 circuits @ $250/circuit = $75,000
- Kitchen Equipment Connections = $45,000

LIGHTING CONTROLS:
- Network Lighting Control System = $35,000
- Occupancy Sensors and Switches = $8,500

FIRE ALARM SYSTEM:
Complete addressable system including:
- Control Panel = $8,000
- Devices and Wiring = $32,000

LABOR COSTS:
- Electricians: 2,400 hours @ $85/hr = $204,000
- Helpers: 1,600 hours @ $45/hr = $72,000

OTHER COSTS:
1. Permits and Inspections = $5,000
2. Project Management = $25,000
3. As-Built Documentation = $2,500
4. Testing and Commissioning = $8,000
5. Overhead and Profit (15%) = $91,935

TOTAL ESTIMATED COST: $704,885

Notes:
1. Includes allowance for conduit, wire, boxes, and supports
2. Includes startup and testing
3. Assumes normal working hours
4. Excludes utility company charges
5. Prices based on current market conditions
6. Includes 5% contingency for unforeseen conditions

This estimate is based on the drawings provided and typical commercial construction costs. Actual costs may vary based on local market conditions, final product selections, and site-specific requirements.
